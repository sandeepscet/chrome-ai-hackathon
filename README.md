## Introduction
Hello everyone! I’m thrilled to present a Chrome extension that revolutionizes how we read and create content on the web. With cutting-edge AI built right into your browser, without sharing your data.

Have you ever struggled to make sense of complex  content or wished you could effortlessly craft better responses? Do you find yourself toggling between tools. This is exactly the problem my Chrome extension solves.

Now, let me show you how it works.

## Features

1. Create Content by Add Prompts
First, the extension lets you add custom prompts, either tied to a specific website or universally accessible.Whether you're filling out forms, drafting emails, or leaving comments, your personalized prompts are always just a click away.
User also can use custom prompt on any textarea from website.

2. Simplifies information overload.

Next, with a simple text selection, the extension brings powerful actions like summarizing, simplifying, or even extracting key points with ELIS. It's like having an AI assistant for instant insights.

1. Chat with Webpage feature.
This allows you to interact directly with any webpage using a sidebar. Whether it’s a blog, a technical article, or a policy document, just ask a question, and the extension provides instant, relevant answers.

With this extension, AI is no longer an abstract concept; it’s a practical, accessible tool built into your browser, ready to simplify how you create and consume content.
